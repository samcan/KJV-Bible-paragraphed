# KJV-Bible-paragraphed
Convert KJV Bible USFM files into paragraphed LaTeX files.

## Why this project?
Anecdotally, the vast majority of Bibles sold today have chapter
and verse divisions. However, [these divisions are not original to
the text][1], being added at a later time: chapters were added in the
mid-13th century and the verse scheme used today was devised in the
mid-16th century.

These chapter and verse schemes, while helpful for study and reference,
also have the side-effect of encouraging us to cherry-pick verses out of
context. We also lose the context of the book as a whole: Imagine reading
only a sentence of a letter! But that is what we do to the epistles, among
the rest of the books of the Bible. Laying the text out in a paragraphed form
with chapter and verse divisions removed, encourages us to treat the text of
each book as a whole. Rather than focusing on a particular sentence, we must
focus on the paragraph, and its relation to the book and the author's overall
message.

Could one read a book straight through, even with chapter and verse divisions?
Yes. However, it is the project leader's belief that they are an unnecessary
distraction and can be removed. There are plenty of sources with chapter and verse
divisions that can still be used for reference.

This project intends to provide LaTeX files of the individual books (not including
the apocraphya) of the King James Version translation of the Bible, as well as a
LaTeX file combining the individual files.
